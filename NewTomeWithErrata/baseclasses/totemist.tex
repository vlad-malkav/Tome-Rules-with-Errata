\quot{My soul burns with the strength of the behir of my ancestors.}

\desc{Totemists are people whose souls are filled with an arbitrarily blue flame that causes them to channel the beast souls of the natural world. This being the natural world of \emph{Dungeons \& Dragons}, those beast souls are crazy crap like displacer beasts and give the Totemist real magical powers.}

\desc{A Totemist has powers that are comparable in strength to spells that are usable an unlimited number of times in a day. However, each power has a cool-down period that makes it unlikely to be used twice in the same battle. These powers are Charisma based, so it is to be expected that a Totemist will put Charisma as their primary attribute.}

\ability{Starting Age:}{As Druid}

\ability{Starting Equipment:}{6d4x10gp}

\ability{Alignment:}{Totemists can be of any alignment, but like Magical Beasts that alignment is largely to be taken with a grain of salt. They behave a lot like animals, so even if they are totally all chaotic evil and torture fools it's more like how cats spend an hour killing a mouse if they aren't hungry than any depraved sadism. Totemists hardly detect a non-neutral alignment at all even if they have one.}

\ability{Hit Die:}{d8}

\ability{Good Saving Throws:}{Will}

\ability{Skill Points:}{4+Int}

\ability{Class Skills:}{Balance, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Hide, Intimidate, Jump, Knowledge (Any), Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Search, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Survival, Swim, Use Magic Device.}

\end{table}\smallskip\noindent All of the following are Class Features of the Totemist class.


\ability{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Totemists are proficient with Simple Weapons, as well as the Trident, the Kukri, the shortsword, the gladius, the light and heavy pick, the shortbow, the longbow, the pincerstaff, the net, and the guisarme. Totemists are proficient with light and medium armor.

\ability{Soulmelds (Su):} A Totemist has the ability to call upon a number of special blue glowing intangible yet vaguely beast-related wardrobe accessories that cause them to glow blue and gain additional powers. Each Soulmeld is unique, and should have its own name (check the Soulmeld chart below in order to name it). Each Soulmeld has a Basic bonus and a Totemic Power. A Totemist can only show a fraction of the Soulmelds they have at a time. At first level, the Totemist "knows" 3 Soulmelds and learns two additional Soulmelds every time they gain a Totemist level. The number of Soulmelds that can actually be used at one time is the character's number of Chakras, which is 2 at first level, rising to 3 at 2nd, 4 at 5th, 5 at 8th, 6 at 11th, 7 at 14th, 8 at 16th, and finally 9 at 19th. It takes 1 minute of meditation to change which Soulmelds are available (up to the character's number of Chakras), but only a Swift Action to activate and display any or all of them. Soulmelds shed light as a torch. Actually calling upon the Totem's power is usually a Standard Action.

\ability{Basic Bonuses:}{Every Soulmeld (even Advanced or Giant-Size Soulmelds) has exactly one Basic Bonus, which is defined when the Soulmeld is learned:}

\desc{\listone
\item Deflection bonus to AC (1/3 level, rounded up)
\item Resistance Bonus to Saving Throws (1/3 level, rounded up)
\item Enhancement Bonus to an attribute (1/3 level, rounded up)
\item Enhancement Bonus to a Skill other than Use Magic Device (Level + 2)
\item Enhancement Bonus to Natural Armor Bonus (1/3 Level, rounded up)
\item Spell Resistance (8 + Level)
\item Energy Resistance to one Energy type (3 points per level)
\end{list}}

\ability{Basic Totems:}{At first, each Soulmeld is attached to a Basic Totem, and the power delivered when called upon is as such:}

\desc{\listone
\item Ankheg: Spit soul acid out to Short Range. Ranged Touch Attack. Inflicts d4 Acid damage/level and on the Totemist's next turn will inflict a similar amount unless the acid has been doused with vinegar or beer or something in the meantime.
\item Corollax: Rainbow colors shoot off into a Short Ranged Cone. Creatures in the cone must make a Will save or be \emph{stunned} for 1d2 rounds. This is a [Mind Affecting] [Pattern].
\item Carrion Crawler: Touch forces target to make a Fortitude save or be \emph{paralyzed} for a minute.
\item Ash Rat: Heavy Smoke extends around the Totemist like \emph{obscuring mist}. The mists last for 4 rounds, and creatures other than the Totemist suffer 1 point of Fire damage per round that they are in the ashy haze.
\item Flame Snake: Touch forces target to take d4 Fire Damage/level and to make a Fortitude Save against Poison or lose 1d6 Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
\item Blood Hawks: The Totemist makes a ranged touch attack against up to one enemy within Medium Range per level. Each target struck suffers 1d3 of Force damage and 2 points of Constitution Damage from blood loss.
\item Howler: Scream causes Wisdom Damage. Burst out to Short Range. Will Save or suffer d6 Wisdom damage. Totemist is immune, this is a [Mind Affecting] [Sonic] effect.
\item Dark Mantle: As \emph{darkness}, but all light is blocked and it provides complete concealment. Or 3e \emph{darkness} if you prefer.
\item Krenshar: Screech causes target within Short Range to be \emph{panicked} for a d4 rounds if they fail a Will save. This is a [Sonic] [Mind Affecting] [Fear] Effect.
\item Blood Ape: The character increases in size by 1 size category, and their attributes are adjusted as normal. This change lasts for 4 rounds.
\item Mephit: Breath Weapon of something weird and noxious. Extends to a cone out to Short Range. All creatures in the area must pass a Fortitude Save or be \emph{nauseated} for 1d2 rounds.
\item Owlbear: Melee Touch Attack Pins target for 1 round.
\item Rust Monster: As \emph{rusting grasp}.
\item Shocker Lizard: Melee touch attack inflicts d8/level Subdual Electricity damage.
\item Stirge: Melee Touch Attack causes d4 damage/level and heals the Totemist an equal amount as to the damage inflicted on a living creature.
\item Harpoon Spider: A soul harpoon is sent after an enemy within Short Range. Ranged Touch Attack. On a hit, the target suffers d8 Force damage and must make a Fortitude save or be drawn as many squares towards the Totemist as the totemist feels like dragging them (as if bullrushed).
\item 
\end{list}}

\ability{Call Totems (Su):} A Totemist can use the Totem Powers of any active Soulmelds any number of times in a day. However, upon calling upon such a Totem, they may not call on the same Totem for the next three rounds. So at first level a Totemist has only 2 Chakras bound, so they could call upon two different powers in the first two rounds of combat, but then they would be unable to use either one again in the next two rounds of combat, forcing them to fall back on weaponry or hiding. The Save DC of any save a Totem's power offers is 10 + 1/2 Level + Charisma Modifier. And every power is used at the Totemist's Character Level.

\ability{Wild Empathy (Ex):} Totemists can use Handle Animal as if it was frickin Diplomacy and they were speaking the Queen's Bloody English with any Animal or Magical Beast, whether that creature has a language or not.

\ability{Respect for the Dead (Ex):}{At 2nd level, Totemists treat any armor made out of animal parts as if it was a lot easier to use, and reduce the Armor Check Penalty and Armor Stealth Penalty of such armors by 4, making it a lot more likely that they can move at full speed while wearing someone's mother as a breastplate.}

\ability{Woodland Stride (Ex):} Totemists of 2nd level and up are totally at home in natural environments, even really jacked up ones. They ignore naturally occurring difficult terrain and don't take damage from crap like thorns.

\ability{Arcane Sight (Su):} At 3rd level, a Totemist benefits at all times from \emph{Arcane Sight}.

\ability{Better Soulmelds:} At fourth level, each Soulmeld can be attached to a Better Totem, and the power delivered when called upon is as such:

\desc{\listone
\item Aranea: Can throw a soul Web. Creatures within or moving within a 15' burst within short range must make a Reflex Save or be \emph{entangled} and anchored in place. An \emph{entangled} creature may make an Escape Artist or Strength check (DC 20) as a full-round action to wriggle or break free, but if they move out of their square into another square with soul web in it they'll have to make another Reflex save or be caught again. The web dissipates in 1 minute/level or when dismissed, and does not burn.
\item Behir: A line of electricity extends out to short range from the Totemist's mouth. It does 1d6 Electricity Damage/level and allows a Reflex Save for half damage.
\item Chimera: A cone of fire is breathed out to short range. It does 1d6 Fire Damage/level and allows a Reflex Save for half damage.
\item Cloaker: Creates images equivalent to \emph{major image} within Short Range. The Totemist need not concentrate on the images, but they vanish in 4 rounds.
\item Cockatrice: Touch forces target to make a Fortitude Save or be \emph{petrified}.
\item Digester: A cone of Acid is spat out to short range. Targets in the area suffer a d4 Acid Damage/level (Reflex Half), and then the following turn suffer the same amount of damage unless they have cleaned themselves off.
\item Ahuizotl: Melee Touch Attack causes he target to be \emph{blind}.
\item Briarvex: With a melee touch attack, the target suffers 2d6 Force Damage. There are then thorns of force crawling in their skin like a Linkin Park Song, and they take 2d6 of Force Damage each round on the Totemist's turn for 1 round/level. This ongoing damage can be halted by taking a Standard Action to make a DC 15 Heal check to gauge out the force thorns. Each attempt inflicts 1 hit point of damage whether it succeeds or fails.
\item Joystealer: Target within Medium Range must make a Will Save or suffer a d6 of Charisma Damage and be afflicted as per \emph{crushing despair}.
\item Manticore: The Totemist launches a number of spikes of soul energy as their Level distributed between one or more targets within Medium Range. Each spike inflicts 1d6 damage.
\item Pegasus: Totemist gains a 90' Flight Speed with Good Maneuverability for the next 4 rounds. Activating this is a Swift Action.
\item Cloaked Ape: The Totemist gains Fast Healing equal to their level for 4 rounds. This ability can be invoked as a Swift action.
\item Phase Wasp: The Totemist gains the benefits of \emph{true seeing} for 4 rounds.
\item Shadow Mastiff: All other creatures within Short Range must make a Will Save or become Panicked for 1d6 rounds. This is a [Sonic] [Mind Affecting] [Fear] effect.
\item 
\item Unicorn: Heal a touched target by 1d6/level and remove any poisons they are afflicted with.
\item Winter Wolf: The Totemist breathes a cone of Cold out to Short Range. It inflicts d6/level Cold Damage, with Reflex save for half damage.
\end{list}}

\ability{Blood of Soulfire (Su):}{A 5th level Totemist is immune to poison and when they suffer damage from physical attacks they cause 1 point of Force Damage to all creatures within 5' of them as Soulfire splashes out.}

\ability{Beast Companion:}{At 6th level, a Totemist is entitled to a companion. Their companion is a Magical Beast with a CR 2 less than their character level. When the Totemist gains a level, their companion either gets more powerful for no reason or their companion wanders off and they get a new companion. Either way.}

\ability{Advanced Soulmelds:}{At seventh level, each Soulmeld can be attached to an Advanced Totem, and the power delivered when called upon is as such:}

\desc{\listone
\item Basilisk: Target within medium range must make a Fortitude save or be \emph{petrified}.
\item Bulette: The ground trembles as earth and stone excavate themselves at the Totemist's urging. The character can tunnel out up to a 10'x10'x40' area. Every end must be within short range, and yes you can create holes under enemies and drop them in.
\item Blink Dog: As \emph{dimension door}.
\item Displacer Beast: The Totemist gains full displacement and a 50% miss chance for 4 rounds. This is a Swift Action to activate.
\item Ethereal Marauder: The Totemist and everything they carry is shifted to the Ethereal Plane or back to the Material from the Ethereal.
\item Girallon: Spectral arms rip the target to pieces. The Totemist makes 4 melee touch attacks, and each is a claw that inflicts 1d6 Damage / 2 levels.
\item Lamia: As \emph{Charm Monster}. This is a [Mind Affecting] [Compulsion] and allows a Will Save.
\item Nymph: Short Ranged Burst. All creatures in area that can see the Totemist must make a Fortitude Save or be \emph{blind}.
\item Phoenix: For the next 4 rounds, the Totemist is immune to Fire, and heals when they would suffer fire damage. Also there is a 5' burst of flame centered on the Totemist that inflicts d6/level Fire Damage (Reflex Half), and that heals the Totemist because it is Fire Damage.
\item Remorhaz: The Totemist catches on fire, and anything she touches or that even hits her in melee suffers 1d6/level of fire damage from the experience. This effect lasts 4 rounds.
\item Frost Salamander: The Totemist exudes an aura of cold. All creatures that begin their turns within 15' of the Totemist suffer d6/2 levels of Cold Damage. This effect lasts 4 rounds.
\item Mudmaw: Two soul tendrils lash out and grab enemies. The Totemist can make two melee touch attacks against one or two creatures within 10'. Any creature touched is \emph{pinned} for 1 round.
\item Brood Keeper: A spectral swarm races out to engulf your enemies, as summon swarm. The swarm summoned uses your save DC (10 + 1/2 level + Cha modifier) for its abilities, inflicts force damage rather than normal damage, is incorporeal, and persists for four rounds. 
\item 
\item Umber Hulk: One target within Short Range must make a Will Save or be \emph{confused} as per the spell \emph{confusion}. This can be invoked as a Swift Action.

\item Yrthak: Target within Medium Range suffers d6/level Sonic damage, Fortitude half.
\end{list}}

\ability{Speak with Souls (Su):}{A Totemist of 8th level can see the souls of the living and the dead. They are apparently little blue flamy things like in Soul Eater. The Totemist can speak with the souls of the dead as if the dead were still alive. The souls depart in about a week unless they get transformed, consumed, or returned to life before that point.}

\ability{Corpse Fashion (Su):}{Three times a day, a 9th level Totemist can \emph{fabricate} things out of animal parts. This can make things as respectable as hide armor or as creepy as human bone swords.}

\ability{Reincarnate (Su):}{Three times a week, a 9th level Totemist can bring someone back from the dead in a new body. Like \emph{reincarnation}.}

\ability{Astounding Soulmelds:} At tenth level, each Soulmeld can be attached to an Astounding Totem, and the power delivered when called upon is as such:

\item

\item Inferno Spider: Can throw a \emph{flaming} soul Web. Creatures within or moving within a 15' burst within short range must make a Reflex Save or be \emph{entangled} and anchored in place. An \emph{entangled} creature may make an Escape Artist or Strength check (DC 20) as a full-round action to wriggle or break free, but if they move out of their square into another square with soul web in it they'll have to make another Reflex save or be caught again. The web dissipates in 1 minute/level or when dismissed, and is on fire. All creatures suffer 1d8 + Level Fire Damage every round they begin in the area of the web.
\item Pixie: All creatures in a 15' burst within Medium range must make a Will Save or fall \emph{asleep} for 10 minutes/level. This is a [Mind Affecting] effect.

\item 
\end{list}}

\ability{Auto-Life (Su):} If a 12th level Totemist has been dead for a whole day, they reincarnate into a new body unless something has happened to their soul in the meantime. This does not cost them a level, it's just slightly disconcerting.

\subsubsection*{Soulmelds Table}
To name a Soulmeld, combine the Totem with an adjective, a color, and a thingy. This can go in any order you want. So for example, you might have Dimming Electric Corollax Wings or Corollax Crushing Cyan Gauntlets. Whatever. You can fudge it a bit so it sounds less ridiculous or not, at your option. Also, you can really have your soulmelds be any color you want, as long as they are blue.
