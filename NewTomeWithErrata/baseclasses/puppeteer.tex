\desc{It is well known to those who investigate such things that electrical energy can bring animation to the freshly dead in much the same way as positive or negative energy can. Those who have a natural inclination towards commanding the lightning can live out their life in obscurity or they can investigate their own abilities.

Those of a particularly investigative bent can accomplish much towards animating the dead and even creating new life. The puppeteer is one such person.}

\ability{Alignment:}{Electricity is a destructive force, but it is also the source of life. The Puppeteer focuses on the animating aspects, and a lot of them are Lawful. But they don't have to be.}

\ability{Races:}{Puppeteers appear in all races, though significant portions of many races live in areas where being a Puppeteer is illegal.}

\ability{Starting Gold:}{6d6x10 gp (210 gold)}

\ability{Starting Age:}{As Rogue.}

\ability{Hit Die:}{d8}

\ability{Disrupting Shock (Sp):}{As a standard action, a 2nd level Puppeteer can create an electrical discharge inside another creature's body. This effect causes a d6 of damage and stuns the target for one round.

\ability{Perpetual Storm (Sp):}{A 5th level Puppeteer benefits from \emph{call lightning} at all times.}

\ability{Create Golem (Su):}{An 8th level Puppeteer can create Flesh Golems. These do not require the expenditure of XP. The latest creation, and \emph{only} the last one created by the Puppeteer is immune to the berserking trait as it is fully under his control.}
