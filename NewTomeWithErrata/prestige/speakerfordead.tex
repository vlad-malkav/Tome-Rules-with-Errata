\quot{``For ten thousand years our ancestors have lived and died in this land and not once has the world been swallowed by an unending chasm into the Abyss. They tell me that they are disappointed in your actions, and I am here to make their displeasure known."}

The souls of those that die are drawn inexorably towards the outer planes to await their punishment or rewards as befits the whim of the powerful beings that dwell there -- outsiders and the gods themselves. A few get drawn back to the world of the living, but the vast majority become petitioners, and the memories of these lives beyond counting are gradually forgotten and lost to time.

Or they would be, if the Speakers did not endeavor to catch these memories and keep them safe against a time in the future when they may be needed again.
