\section{Unusual Races}

For a long time, there has been a definite pro-prettiness bias in the rules of D\&D. That is, elves (who are pretty) get a much better deal as player characters than do hobgoblins (who are ugly). This dates back to when races had mandatory alignments and people wanted to discourage Evil player characters from coming in and ruining games (which let's face it, a lot of evil PCs do). And while this has had the desired effect of keeping the number of orc player characters down and their impact minimal, it hasn't been good for game balance at all. Some people really want to be a gray skinned dude with shark's teeth, and they'll play whatever game mechanics are given to them. These players will be playing at the same level as other characters, and that means that they should be playing at the same power level! Really, all the unusual races are optional, so there's no purpose served in screwing them over. In the past, many races have simply been given insufficient goodies to be worth playing (Half-Orcs), or were given good enough abilities but then over-charged in levels for them so horribly as to make the character unplayable (Hobgoblins). We don't hold with that at all. If you don't want someone to play an ogre or goblin in your game, just don't let them play one. It's seriously not even a deal.

Furthermore, for some reason there has been a massive fear of giving straight statistic enhancements to characters without a level adjustment. I don't even understand that, because Halflings already get all that and more. Really, a character who gets +2 to two attributes and a total of +4 to skills and darkvision isn't even impressive compared to a Deep Halfling, so the ginormous fear that people have of letting Hobgoblins and Aasimar into games is perplexing. That being said, what follows are write-ups for the following races playable as normal starting characters in a 1st level game:

\input{races/aasimar}
\input{races/drow}
\input{races/dwarf}
\input{races/elf}
\input{races/feytouched}
\input{races/gnome}
\input{races/goblin}
\input{races/half-elf}
\input{races/halfling}
\input{races/half-orc}
\input{races/hobgoblin}
\input{races/human}
\input{races/kobold}
\input{races/orc}
\input{races/tiefling}

\section{Powerful Races}

Level adjustments don't work at all. Characters end up with skill rank maximums that prevent them from taking prestige classes appropriate to their level and they have hit dice that are low enough that they end up getting caught by spells like cloudkill that are designed to keep the henchmen out of a climactic battle, and so on and so forth. Furthermore, while the concept is busted, the implementation is even worse. Characters end up getting LAs assigned to them based on the sum total of their abilities (disregarding hit dice) and then having them added on to the hit dice (disregarding abilities). Monstrous creatures end up paying for rather minor abilities more than once and the end result is that characters who really aren't good at anything end up being counted as being higher level than ``normal" characters who can outperform them in every way. That has to stop. In general, a monster that is built like a PC is about 1 CR better than one right out of the Monster Manual. CR really is supposed to equal Level, so we're going to be running with the races which are playable under that rubric:
Powerful Monsters As PCs, or ``Beholder Mages That Don't Make Us Cry."

Monsters need to be able to be easy blends of character levels and monster stats. We know that its completely awesome to fight evil mastermind wizards that might just be beholders or giants or some other big monster, and its equally neat to play a cursed vampire warriors who's trying to redeem his soul. Designers up to this point have attempted to stop players from doing both by making these options unplayable or ``the suck", so its time to right this wrong. To start, let us be perfectly honest about two things:

\begin{enumerate}\itemspace
   \item We want to play monsters.
   \item We know that the current ECL (Effective Character Level), LA (Level Adjustment), monster PrCs, and monster progression systems don't work\ldots\  like, at all.
\end{enumerate}

Ok, now that we've cleared that up, we can begin. [I could get into elaborate explanations of why these separate systems don't work, but lets just say that the flaws are self-evident if you put a PC frost giant with only Wizard levels up against an NPC frost giant with only Wizard levels and CRed at the PC's level, or you try to play a Vampire with its +8 level adjustment and minimum character level of 5. We don't even have to talk about the Beholder Mage, an atrocity against the D\&D community in both its incarnations.]

Monsters tend to be build along four kinds of design philosophies.

\begin{itemize}\itemspace
   \item \textbf{Characters:} This is the ``as a character" philosophy, which makes monsters at a certain CR where they are perfectly suited to fight parties of characters at that level, but might overpower a weaker party or single character or be a total pushover to more powerful individuals or parties. Giants, gnolls, yuan-ti, goblinoids and other monsters who are expect to use PC-level tactics and equipment fall into this category.
   \item \textbf{Glass Jaws and Sucker Punches AKA Suckers:} These monsters, which we'll just call ``Suckers" for their ability to suck and sucker punch. Usually they have an extremely powerful attack that can sucker punch a party, but they have some glaring weakness that means that they will go down extremely quickly if you exploit this weakness. Sprites, with their fabulously low HPs and powerful magic are a fine example of this monster. ``Closet trolls" like trolls and Pouncing dire animals fall into this category because they are extremely dangerous in enclosed spaces (better than any three fighting characters of their CR), but they die easily if you can attack them at range and stay at a distance.
   \item \textbf{Puzzle Monsters:} These monsters are in fact more puzzle than monster. They usually are unbeatable unless you know their one weakness, meaning that players who don't know the right Monster Manual by heart usually die to these things. Classic examples from old editions of D\&D like the Windwalkers would only die to a single spell from the spell list which you may or may not know or have on hand, but 3.x has from eased away from this level of arbitrariness. Now we have monsters like Swarms and incorporeal monsters who may be immune to all your normal weapon attacks (a killer for a party without a damage-capable spellcaster) and several kind of plants or oozes that seem to have random and crazy defenses when you attack them (like splitting into more monsters).
   \item \textbf{Awesome Because Its Awesome AKA Player Killers (PKs):} Some Monsters are just built to make players cry. Dragons are the classic example, as they are traditionally CRed about two to four lower than they should be, and some other monsters have also been unofficially given the [awesome] subtype, meaning that players will always remember these monsters for being Party Killers. Angels, beholders, monsters with PC spellcasting, and drow typically fall into this category.
\end{itemize}


Can you see the problem with making these creatures into playable and balanced characters? Character monsters and PKs can be easily modified into playable characters by modifying raw stats, but Suckers and Puzzle Monsters need massive rewrites before they can be playable characters.

\section{Converting Monsters Into Characters}

\subsection{Method 1: The Easy Way}
Assume that a monster is a character of its CR+1(modified if it is a monster with the [Awesome] tag), and that its stat modifiers are derived from the assumption that the base monster was built using the Elite Array (highest monster stat -- highest elite stat, then repeat for next lowest, etc). For level-dependant effects like skill point maxes, feat prereqs, etc, use the monster's CR+1. Round ability stat mods down to nearest multiple of 2(negative mods up to multiple of 2), and CRs down to nearest whole number.

The nice part of this method is that it is easy, fast, and you can get to playing a monster immediately without as lot of DM intervention or paperwork. The downside is that you might get an underpowered or overpowered monster character if you are not careful (like you forgot that Dragons are actually CRed two less than they should be, or that Sprites are unplayable).

Here's two examples:

\begin{itemize}\itemspace
   \item \textbf{Minotaur:} Its Base CR is 4, and add +1 for being a PC. Its stat mods are (monster-elite array) Str 19-15=+4, Con 15-14=+0(rounded down) Dex 10-13=-2 (rounded) Wis 10-12= -2 Int 10, Cha 8-10= -2 Int 8-7=+0, for a total of +4 Str, -2 Dex, -2 Int, -2, Cha -2 Wis, which is perfectly reasonable. It's a level 5 PC with skill rank maxes of 8 and 6 monster HD.
      Frankly, it's a warrior class with a little bit of punch from natural armor, small stat mods from its size, and some fun but not good noncombat abilities. It's nothing to write home about as a 5th level character, and that's much more reasonable than the ECL 8 the MM would have you play it at.
   \item \textbf{Succubus:} CR 7, +1 for being a PC. Stat mods equal Cha 26-15=+10(rounded), Int 16-14=+2, Wis 14-13=+0(rounded), Str 13- 12=+2, Con 12- 10= +2, Dex 12-8=+4 for a +10 Cha, +2 Int, +2 Str, +2 Con, +4 Dex.
      It's an 8th level character who is almost as good as a Warlock of its level. Generally, it's a far better 8th level character than the than the ECL 14 the MM would have you pay. The fact that its abilities will never grow in power is offset by the fact that it has a high Cha, and so good DCs on its spell-likes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method 2}
This method is the same as Method 1, but it goes a bit further by converting HD to actually appropriate HD by giving the monster the HD that equals its CR and BAB. This corrects problems just as excess HD from giants and undead.

Basically, look that the monster's HD and BAB. What kind of HD would it need to keep about the same BAB and HPs, but would give it the appropriate number of HD to fit its CR/level (which also fixes Saves to reasonably levels). Assign it that HD, and move on with your life.

Here's an example:
Fire Giant. Ok, the Fire Giant is a CR 11 as a PC, and notice that it has a BAB of 11, Great! Normally, it has 15 HD which leads to some craziness if he ever gets a Con boost and it has saves that are a little too big, so lets convert it. Lets give it 11 Barbarian HD(d12s, +1 BAB, good Fort save). We see that he keeps his BAB of 11, his HPs change from 142 to 133, and its base saves are Fort +7, Will/Ref +3 like an actual 11th level character instead of Fort +9, Will/Ref +5.

\subsection{Method 3}
This Method is being saved for our upcoming Tome of Tiamat. Lets just say that is the version of monster progression classes that you actually wanted to be written.

\subsection{Sample conversions}

Here are some relatively simple character conversions:

\subsubsection{Gnoll (Minimum Level 2)}

    \item 3 Starting Hit Dice (3d8 HP; 4 + Int Bonus x 6 skill points; +1 Fort, +3 Reflex, +1 Will; +2 BAB)
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Ogre (Minimum Level 4)}

Giants, even the lowly Ogre, are very specialized creatures. They dominate melee at their level, and really suck at everything else. As monsters, that makes them dangerous. While their glass jaws often leave them in situations that they cannot survive or even put up a decent showing, their laser-like focus can allow them to brutalize characters higher level than themselves if the lighting is just right. As characters, though, this makes them somewhat underwhelming. The ability to win super hard in one encounter only to die horribly in the next is worth less than nothing in a campaign game. An Ogre is a vulnerable and weak character for his level, but he does shine brightly if he can sucker opponents into melee. As such, Ogres really only do well in large, highly varied parties. As long as the remaining characters have potential bases covered extremely well, the fact that a single Ogre can't always pull his weight won't matter as much. For this reason, an Ogre often makes a better cohort than he does a primary character.

\listone
    \item Large Size
    \item 40' movement
    \item Giant Type
    \item Low-light vision and Darkvision (60')
    \item +6 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, -4 Charisma.
    \item +5 Natural Armor
    \item Proficiency in Light Armor, Medium Armor, Martial Weapons, and Simple Weapons.
    \item Favored Classes: Barbarian and Ranger
    \item Automatic Languages: Giant, Common
    \item Bonus Languages: Draconic, Dwarvish, Goblin, Halfling, Orc, Terran.
    \item 4 Starting Hit Dice (4d10; 4 + Int Bonus x 7 skill points; +4 Fort, +1 Reflex, +1 Will; +4 BAB)
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Frost Giant (Minimum Level 10)}

Right out of the box, the Frost Giant is a bad dude capable of rescuing the head of state from ninjas. Based largely on Norse mythology, these bad boys are big and bad. In fact, at 15 feet tall, they are about as big as you can get and still count as a large creature. That makes it pretty hard for them to find mounts, or fit into small buildings, and do all kinds of other crap that adventurers want to do. But it's not impossible. A Frost Giant isn't a Cloud Giant, he doesn't need people to make new doors to accommodate him, he just needs special doors to get through without it being really inconvenient.

A frost giant gets by in human society mostly because most people wouldn't dare mess with him. And that makes for a decent enough 10th level character.

\listone
    \item Large Size
    \item 40' movement
    \item Giant Type (Cold subtype)
    \item Low-light vision
    \item +12 Strength, +8 Constitution, +2 Wisdom
    \item +9 Natural Armor
    \item Proficiency in Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, and Martial Weapons.
    \item Rock Throwing and Catching (a Frost Giant's rocks have a range increment of 120 feet).
    \item Favored Classes: Fighter and Barbarian
    \item Cold Immunity and Fire Vulnerability
    \item Automatic Languages: Giant, Common
    \item Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Draconic, Dwarvish, Gnoll, Orc.
    \item 10 Starting Hit Dice (10d10; 4 + Int Bonus x 13 skill points; +7 Fort, +3 Reflex, +3 Will; +10 BAB)
\end{list}
