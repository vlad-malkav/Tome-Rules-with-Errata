\quot{``Do you know what it means when a man has a sword made of blue soulfire? It means he can kill you with a sword made of blue soulfire.''}

\desc{A Soulborn is a character whose soul is on completely arbitrary blue fire. This allows them to wreathe themselves in magical energies that give them jedi powers as if they had a number of magic items that enhanced their abilities. They can also create a lightsaber made out of soulfire that they use to chop things up.}

\ability{Necrocarnum Option:}{Some characters will want to be powered by Necrocarnum instead of Incarnum. That's fine. Such a character's soulfire is dim and spooky looking. Any references to shedding light like a torch are ignored for Necrocarnum Soulborn.}

\ability{Playing a Soulborn:}{The Soulborn is a warrior whose weapon is as heavy as their soul. As such they can make a passable Strength Warrior or a passable Dexterity warrior. In addition they have a bunch of powers that work off of Charisma, so it is to be expected that Charisma would be their first or second best attribute. In most cases, a Soulborn's tactics are going to be to run up and smack things.}

\ability{Starting Gold:}{5d6x10 gp (175 Gold)}

\ability{Starting Age:}{As Paladin.}

\ability{Alignment:}{Soulborn can be any alignment, but they tend to be total douchebags about it regardless. Soulborn feel compelled to be ``extreme" in their moral and ethical tirades and favor action and dickery rather than passively letting shit go. Even Neutral Soulborn get all tweaked up about ``balance" and shit. They detect their alignment as if they were outsiders or clerics.}

\ability{Hit Die:}{d10}

\ability{Class Skills:}{The Soulborn's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are  Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge [Any] (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Ride (Dex), Search (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha)}

\ability{Skills/Level:}{4 + Intelligence Bonus}

\smallskip\noindent All of the following are Class Features of the Soulborn class.

\ability{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:}{Soulborn are proficient with all Simple and Martial Weapons. They are also proficient with Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor, and with Shields (but not Tower Shields).}

\ability{Soulblade (Su):}{With a Swift Action, a Soulborn can call into existence a weapon of blue soul fire. The soulblade generally looks like a culturally appropriate bastard sword, but it may appear otherwise in the hands of Soulborn characters from other cultures or with different combat styles. The Soulblade is a light weapon that does a d10 damage and has a threat range of 18-20. It has an enhancement bonus equal to one third of the character's level (round up). While out, the soulblade sheds light like a torch, and it vanishes the moment that it leaves the Soulborn's hand (though it can be recalled at a later time with a Swift Action). This weapon does Force damage and therefore ignores Hardness and is Super Effective against Incorporeal opponents.}

\ability{Soulmelds (Su):}{A Soulborn has the ability to call upon a number of special blue glowing intangible wardrobe accessories that cause them to glow blue and gain additional powers. Each Soulmeld is unique, and should have its own name (check the Soulmeld chart below in order to name it). Each Soulmeld has a Basic bonus and a Special bonus. A Soulborn can only use a fraction of the Soulmelds they have at a time. At first level, the Soulborn ``knows" 2 Soulmelds and learns an additional Soulmeld every time they gain a Soulborn level. Whenever they gain a level, they may trade one of the Soulmelds they know for a different Soulmeld. The number of Soulmelds that can actually be used at one time is the character's number of Chakras, which is 1 at first level, rising to 2 at 3rd, 3 at 6th, 4 at 9th, 5 at 12th, 6 at 15th, 7 at 17th, and finally 8 at 20th. It takes 1 minute of meditation to change which Soulmelds are available (up to the character's number of Chakras), but only a Swift Action to activate any or all of them. This activation can be combined with the action to activate a Soulblade if desired. Soulmelds shed light as a torch.

\smallskip
\textit{Basic Bonuses: }Every Soulmeld (even Advanced or Giant-Size Soulmelds) has exactly one Basic Bonus, which is defined when the Soulmeld is learned:}
