\combatfeat{Sniper}{[Combat]}
{Your shooting is precise and dangerous.}
{Your range increments are 50\% longer than they would ordinarily be. Any benefit of being within 30' of an opponent is retained out to 60'.}
{You do not suffer a -4 penalty when firing a ranged weapon into melee and never hit an unintended target in close combats or grapples.}
{Your ranged attacks ignore Cover Bonuses (total cover still bones you).}
{Opponents struck by your ranged attacks do not automatically know what square your attack came from, and must attempt to find you normally.}
{Any time you hit an opponent with a ranged weapon, it is counted as a critical threat. If your weapon already had a 19-20 threat range, increase its critical multiplier by 1.}
