{You suffer no penalties for firing from unstable ground, a running steed, or any of that.}
{You may take a full round action to take a double move and make a single ranged attack from any point during your movement.}
{You may take a full round action to run a full four times your speed and make a single ranged attack from any point during your movement. You retain your Dexterity modifier to AC while running.}
