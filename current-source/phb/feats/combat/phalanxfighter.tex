\combatfeat{Phalanx Fighter}{[Combat]}
{You fight well in a group.}
{You may take attacks of opportunity even while flat footed.}
{Any Dodge bonus to AC you gain is also granted to any adjacent allies for as long as you benefit from the bonus and your ally remains adjacent.}
{Charging is an action that provokes an attack of opportunity from you. This attack is considered to be a ``readied attack" if it matters for purposes like setting against a charge.}
{You may attack with a reach weapon as if it was not a reach weapon. Thus, a medium creature would normally threaten at 5' and 10' with a reach weapon.}
{You may take an Aid Another action once per round as a free action. You provide double normal bonuses from this effect.}
