\combatfeat{Mage Slayer}{[Combat]}
{You have trained long and hard to kill magic users. Maybe you hate them, maybe you just noticed that most of the really dangerous creatures in the world use magic.}
{You gain Spell Resistance of 5 + Character Level.}
{Damage you inflict is considered ``ongoing damage" for the purposes of concentration checks made before the beginning of your next round. All your attacks in a round are considered the same source of continuing damage.}
{Creatures cannot cast defensively within your threat range.}
{Your attacks ignore Deflection bonuses to AC.}
{When a creature uses a [Teleportation] effect within medium range of yourself, you may choose to be transported as well. This is not an action.}
