\descfeat{Abode of Earth [Elemental]}{You are at home within the earth.}
\shortability{Prerequisites:}{(Earth) subtype, Burrow speed, Character level 3+}
\shortability{Benefits:}{Your Burrow speed improves by 10' or to a minimum of 30', and you may burrow through rock.  You may leave a tunnel or leave the earth behind you undisturbed, as you choose.  If you leave the earth undisturbed, there is no sign of your passage unless you are in a square adjacent to a surface, except to creatures with Tremorsense or who make the Perception check to hear you.  The Perception check is not made more difficult by the earth you are in, just by distance through it.  Other rocks and earthen walls do interfere as normal.}
