\shortability{Prerequisite:}{Character Level 3+, (Cold) Subtype}
\shortability{Benefit:}{Your square counts as if it had the \emph{Grease} spell cast on it, except that the slick is made of ice and has the (Cold) descriptor.  Any square you leave has this effect on it, lasting until the end of your next turn.  You never slip on ice, making you immune to this effect.}
