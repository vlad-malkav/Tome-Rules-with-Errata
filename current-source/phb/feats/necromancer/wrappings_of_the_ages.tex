\descfeat{Wrappings of the Ages [Necromantic]}
{The ancient secrets by which unlife can be sustained in mummification have been unearthed.}
\shortability{Prerequisite:}{Character level 8}
\shortability{Benefit:}{You can create mummies. In addition, any undead you create has their natural armor increase by +3. Also, any time your undead rest (take no actions) in an enclosed space that has never been touched by the sun, the location counts as a Tomb for them as long as they inhabit it (see New Rules). In all other ways, the area is not a Tomb.\\
You automatically control up to your Charisma modifier in undead created by this feat, but no undead can have a CR greater than two less than your character level.}
