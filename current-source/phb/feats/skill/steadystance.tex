{You can fight just about anywhere.}
{You gain a +3 bonus to your Balance checks.}

{If your opponent is balancing, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks unless they succeed at beating you in an opposed Balance check.}
{All Balance DCs are halved for you.}
{You never suffer any impairment or damage from anything you're standing on, whether it's molten lava, a cloud, or even another creature. Ambient conditions, such as lighting or weather, can still impair you.}
