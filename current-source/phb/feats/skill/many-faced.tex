\skillfeat{Many-Faced}{[Skill:Disguise]}
{You change identities so often even you don't remember what you look like anymore.}
{You gain +3 to your Disguise checks.}
{When creating a disguise, you roll twice and take the better result.}
{You can use \spell{Nystul's magic aura} as a spell-like ability at will, with a caster level equal to your character level and a save DC of 10 + \half your character level + your Cha modifier.}
{You can create a disguise as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty to your Disguise check. You can't be under direct observation while doing this, but you can use Bluff to create a diversion to allow you to change guises, as for the Hide skill.}
{You can choose an appearance that anyone viewing you with scrying or other divination magic sees instead of your ``real" appearance. Even someone who benefits from \spell{true seeing} must succeed on a caster level check (DC 11 + your ranks in Disguise) to penetrate the illusion.}
