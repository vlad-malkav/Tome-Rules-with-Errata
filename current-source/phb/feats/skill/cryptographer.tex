\skillfeat{Cryptographer}{[Skill:Decipher Script]}
{You're good at reading things no one intended you to.}
{You gain +3 to your Decipher Script checks.}
{You can decipher a written spell (like a scroll) without using \spell{read magic}, if you succeed on a Decipher Script check of DC 20 + the spell's level. You can try once per day on any particular written spell.}
{You don't trigger written magic traps (like \spell{explosive runes} or \spell{symbols}) by reading them. You can disable them with Decipher Script as if you were using Disable Device. You can read the material hidden by a \spell{secret page} with a DC 25 Decipher Script check.}
{When you cast a spell from a scroll, the spell's save DC is equal to 10 + the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier + any other applicable bonuses, and its caster level is equal to your character level, plus other applicable bonuses.}
{Reading text using Decipher Script is a free action for you. You may disable written magical traps as a swift action, and you can cast 5th-level or lower spells from scrolls as a swift action.}
