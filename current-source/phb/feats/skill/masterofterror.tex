\skillfeat{Master of Terror}{[Leadership] [Skill:Intimidate]}
{You scare people so bad they follow you around hoping you won't hurt them.}
{Whenever you use Intimidate in combat, it affects everyone within 30 feet of you.}{
You gain followers. Your leadership score is equal to your ranks in Intimidate plus your Charisma modifier.}
{You gain a cohort who enjoys frightening your underlings almost as much as you do. A cohort is an intelligent and loyal creature with a CR at least 2 less than your character level. Cohorts gain levels when you do.}
{You gain the frightful presence ability. When you speak or attack, enemies within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + \half your character level + your Cha modifier) or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. An opponent that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.}
{Your opponents take a -2 morale penalty to saving throws if they can see you and you are within medium range (based on your character level).}
