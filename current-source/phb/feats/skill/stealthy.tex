\skillfeat{Stealthy}{[Skill:Hide]}
{If someone sees you, you have to kill them.}
{You gain a +3 bonus to your Hide checks.}
{You can Hide as a free action after attacking, and snipe with melee attacks (or ranged attacks from closer than 10').}
{A constant \spell{nondetection effect} protects you and your equipment, with an effective caster level equal to your ranks in Hide.}
{You can attempt to Hide even when under direct observation, but you take the usual -20 penalty to your check.}
{Even opponents who can see you have trouble locating you. If they succeed at beating your Hide check with Spot (and thus can see you), they have a 50\% concealment miss chance when attacking you, which decreases by 5\% for each point they beat your Hide DC.}
