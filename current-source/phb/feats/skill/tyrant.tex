\skillfeat{Tyrant}{[Leadership] [Skill:Intimidate]}
{You push people around and get larger and larger groups trapped in the iron gauntlet of your brutal rule.}
{You inspire such terror that creatures you intimidate continue to act intimidated after you leave, too afraid to raise their voice in defiance even after you have apparently left them far behind.}
{You can muster a group of followers. Your leadership score is your ranks in Intimidate plus your Strength modifier.}
{Your followers swell in number to that of an army.}
{Your mere presence inspires fear and can break a battle. Enemies with more than 5 hit dice less than you do must make a Will save (DC 10 + Â½ Level + Strength Modifier) of flee in panic. This is a [Fear] effect.}
{Your presence causes despair in even brave opponents. All enemies within 30' of your suffer a -2 Morale penalty to Willpower saves.}
