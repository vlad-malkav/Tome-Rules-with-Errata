\skillfeat{Acrobatic}{[Skill:Tumble]}
{You can totally flip out and kill someone with your gymnastic prowess.}
{You gain a +3 bonus to Tumble checks.}
{When using the Combat Expertise option, your dodge bonus to AC increases by +1. This further increases by +1 for every ten ranks of Tumble you have (+2 at 14, +3 at 24, and so on).}
{If an opponent attempts to bull-rush, overrun, or trample you, if you succeed on Tumble check of DC 25 + their base attack bonus, their movement continues in a straight line to the maximum allowed by their speed, you remain where you were, and you don't suffer from the effects of their bull-rush, overrun, or trample. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from that enemy.}
{If you succeed on a DC 40 Tumble check, you can move 10 feet when taking a 5-foot step.}
{If you succeed on a Tumble check against a DC of 30 + an opponent's base attack bonus, an action that would normally provoke an attack of opportunity doesn't.}
