\skillfeat{Slippery Contortionist}{[Skill:Escape Artist]}
{Your childhood nickname was ``Greasy the Pig," but now people call you ``The Great Hamster."}
{You gain +3 to your Escape Artist checks.}
{While squeezing into a space at least half as wide as your normal space, you may move your normal speed and you take no penalty to your attack rolls or AC for squeezing.}
{You can squeeze through a tight space or an extremely tight space as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty to your Escape Artist check. Opponents grappling you don't get positive size modifiers added to their grapple bonus when you use Escape Artist to try to break their hold.}
{If you succeed on a DC 30 Escape Artist check, you can ignore magical effects that impede movement as if you were under the effects of \spell{freedom of movement} for one round; this is not an action. You can also slip through a \spell{wall of force} or similar barrier with a DC 40 check.}
{You can make an Escape Artist check instead of a saving throw for any effect that would keep you from taking actions. (This does not help against effects that don't allow a saving throw.)}
