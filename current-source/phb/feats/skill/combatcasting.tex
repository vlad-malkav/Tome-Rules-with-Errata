{You gain +3 to your Concentration checks.}
{You can take 10 on Concentration checks and caster level checks.}
{You may maintain concentration on a spell as a move action (DC 25 + spell level). If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you can maintain concentration as a swift action. If you fail your check, you lose concentration.}
