\skillfeat{Investigator}{[Skill:Search]}
{You have an eye for detail and so much patience that going through a 100' by 100' room inch-by-inch doesn't even try it.}
{You can use Search to find traps like a character with trapfinding. If you already have that ability, you gain +3 to your Search checks. Search is always a class skill for you.}
{You can Search a 10' by 10' area with a full-round action.}
{You automatically sense any active magic effects in an area you search. If you succeed on a DC 20 Search check, you can determine their number, strength, and school, as if using \spell{detect magic}.}
{You can Search objects or areas within 30 feet of yourself. You can make a Search check as a swift action.}
{You have an intuitive sense for hidden things. Anytime something that someone has hidden is within 60 feet of you, you know it; if there are multiple things, you know how many. However, you must still make Search checks as normal to locate them.}
