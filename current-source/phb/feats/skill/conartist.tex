\skillfeat{Con Artist}{[Skill:Bluff]}
{You can fool some of the people, all of the time.}
{You gain a +3 bonus to Bluff checks.}
{Magic effects that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth must succeed on a caster level check with DC equal to 10 plus your ranks in Bluff or fail.}
{Divination magic used on you detects a false alignment of your choice. You can present false surface thoughts to \spell{detect thoughts} and similar effects, changing your apparent Intelligence score (and thus your apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in your ``surface thoughts" to be read by such spells or effects.}
{If you beat someone's Sense Motive check by 25, you can instill a \spell{suggestion} in them, as the spell. This suggestion lasts for one hour for each of your character levels.}
{You are protected from all spells and effects that detect or read emotions or thoughts, as by \spell{mind blank}.}
