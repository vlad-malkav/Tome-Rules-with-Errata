\skillfeat{Ghost Step}{[Skill:Move Silently]}
{You might as well be incorporeal for all the noise you make.}
{You gain +3 to your Move Silently checks.}
{Anyone attempting to use Survival to track you must beat you in an opposed check against Move Silently.}
{Creatures with blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or similar abilities do not automatically detect your presence, but must succeed on a Listen check, opposed by your Move Silently check, to notice you.}
{With success on a DC 30 Move Silently check as a standard action, you can control ambient sounds within 30 feet of yourself for a round. You can specifically duplicate any effect from \spell{control sound} (XPH), \spell{silence}, or \spell{ventriloquism}, and in general can make sound you've heard come from any part of the area, displace sounds in the area, or suppress any sounds or sounds. Also, if you take a -10 DC penalty on your Move Silently check, anyone within 30 feet of you can substitute your check result for their own.}
{You're so quiet that people don't even remember you when you're standing right next to them. Your opponents count as flat-footed whenever you attack them.}
