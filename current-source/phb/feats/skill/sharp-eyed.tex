\skillfeat{Sharp-Eyed}{[Skill:Spot]}
{Nothing escapes your sight.}
{You gain a +3 bonus to Spot checks.}
{You can make a Spot check once a round as a free action. You don't take penalties for distractions on your Spot checks.}
{As a move action, you can make a Spot check against a DC of an opponent's Armor Class: if you succeed, you can ignore their Armor and Natural Armor bonus to AC for the next attack you make against them. If you accept a -20 penalty to your check, you can attempt this check as a swift action. Divide any distance penalties you take on Spot checks by two.}
{If you beat an opponent's Hide check with a Spot check at a -10 penalty, you can ignore concealment. If you beat their Hide check at a -30 penalty, you can ignore total concealment.}
{You can see through solid objects, but you take a -20 penalty on your Spot check for each 5'. Divide any distance penalties you take on Spot checks by five.}
