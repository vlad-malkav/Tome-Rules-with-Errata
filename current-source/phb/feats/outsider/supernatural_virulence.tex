\descfeat{Supernatural Virulence [Fiend]}
{Your poison is as much magical as it is biological.}
	\shortability{Prerequisite:}{Must have a poisonous natural weapon.}
	\shortability{Benefit:}{Choose one of your spell-like abilities of 3rd level or lower. Any time you successfully poison a victim, they are also targeted by this spell-like ability as if this effect was cast (this expends one use of the ability). While poisoned with your venom, the victim cannot be affected by your spell-like ability again.}
