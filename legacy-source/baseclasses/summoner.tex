At 16th level, the Summoner gains proficiency with shields.}

\ability{Spellcasting:}{The Summoner is an Arcane Spellcaster with the same spells per day progression as a Sorcerer. A Summoner casts spells from the Summoner Spell List (below). A Summoner automatically knows every spell on her spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing them ahead of time, provided that spell slots of an appropriate level are still available.To cast a Summoner spell, she must have a Charisma at least equal to 10 + the Spell level. The DC and bonus spells of the Summoner's spells is Charisma based.}

\ability{Rapid Summoning:}{A Summoner can cast summoning spells in less time than most other casters. Any Conjuration spell of the [Summoning] subschool that a Summoner casts that would have a casting time of one full round have a casting time of 1 standard action instead. This ability has no effect on spells which already require less than one full round to cast, nor does it affect spells with a casting time greater than one full round.}

\ability{Summoned Cohort:}{Once per day when a Summoner casts a Conjuration spell of the [Summoning] subschool, she may extend its duration to 24 hours. This ability is not cumulative with other effects that increase the duration of a spell.}

\ability{Armored Casting:}{A Summoner casts arcane spells, but she is not affected by the arcane spell failure of any armor or shield she is proficient with. This ability only applies to her Summoner spells, if she is able to cast any other arcane spells, they are affected by arcane spell failure normally.}

\ability{Aura:}{A Summoner's strong connection to the outer planes causes them to be detected very strongly of whatever alignment she has. For purposes of spells like \spell{detect chaos}, levels in Summoner count as Outsider hit dice.}

\ability{Sudden Extend:}{At 2nd level, the Summoner gains Sudden Extend as a bonus feat. If she already has Sudden Extend, she may gain any metamagic feat that she qualifies for instead.}

\ability{Advanced Learning:}{At 3rd level and every two levels afterwards, the Summoner may permanently add one spell to her spell list. This spell must be of a level she can already cast, and it must be of the Conjuration school. Only spells from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list may be added in this way.}

\ability{Extend Summoning:}{Conjuration spells of the [Summoning] subschool that the Summoner casts can be affected by the Extend Spell metamagic for free. At 4th level, the Summoner may apply this free spell extending to spells of 1st level or lower. At 9th level, she may apply it to 2nd level spells, at 14th level she may apply it to 3rd level spells, and at 19th level she may apply Extend Spell for free to 4th level spells.}

\ability{Master Tactician:}{A Summoner learns to fight with many allies. At 6th level, any ally within 30 feet of her may gain a +4 bonus for flanking instead of the normal +2 bonus as long as they can perceive the Summoner.}

\ability{\spell{Summon (Sp)}:}{At 7th level, a Summoner can attempt to summon outsiders with an alignment identical to her own.
