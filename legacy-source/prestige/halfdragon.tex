\quot{``Also, dragons are pretty! Very pretty.''}

Half Dragon is a character class that can be used to make a monster into a more ``dragon-like'' monster. It can also be taken by player characters who want to be more dragon-like, for whatever reason. Maybe they got spilled with dragon blood and became dragon-like themselves. Maybe their mother slept with a dragon in disguise. Maybe the dragon wasn't in disguise. I don't want to hear about it.

\smallskip\noindent All of the following are Class Features of the Half Dragon prestige class.

\ability{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:}{The Half Dragon gains no proficiency with armor or weapons.}

\ability{Breath Weapon (Su):}{A Half Dragon is able to emit a deadly breath weapon. The energy type of the weapon is appropriate to whatever dragon type is involved in the dragon-half. As appropriate, it will either come out as a cone with short range, or a line which is twice that long. The breath weapon does 1d6 of damage per character level (or CR) of the Half Dragon and the Reflex save DC is 10 + \half Hit Dice + Con Modifier. Using this breath weapon is a Standard action, and once used it cannot be used again for 2d4 rounds.}

\ability{Wings of the Dragon (Ex):}{At second level, a half dragon grows dragon wings. They may be small and cute or huge and cloak-like. But regardless of size or mass ratios, they allow the character to fly half again as fast as their land movement rate with average maneuverability.}

\ability{Subtypes:}{A Half Dragon of second level has the Dragon Subtype, as well as whatever elemental or energy subtypes is appropriate for whatever kind of dragon is manifest within her. For example: a Half Black Dragon would gain subtypes of [Dragon, Water].}
