Orcs get the short end of the stick. They can eat pretty much anything and they have to because their race has lost every major war since\ldots{} well \textit{forever}. Orcs are extremely specialized, and rarely see play as anything except a Barbarian. However, some players will want to diversify the concept into say\ldots{} a Rogue, Assassin, or Fighter build. That works okay, but remember that an Orc always brings "hitting things really hard" to the party. The Orcs other limitations are pretty severe, so taking a class combination that doesn't accentuate the narrow scope of Orc advantages is probably a mistake in the long run.
