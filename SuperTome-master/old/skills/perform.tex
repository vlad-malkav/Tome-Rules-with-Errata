\skillentry{Perform}{(Cha)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Like Craft, perform is a single skill with several styles. You can know a number of different Perform styles equal to your number of ranks in perform. If you make a check using one of your known styles then you apply your full ranks. If you make a check using a style that you do not know then you don't apply your ranks to that check (as if you were untrained).

Here are some suggested styles (feel free to make up your own):
\begin{itemize*}
\item Act (comedy, drama, mime)
\item Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
\item Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
\item Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
\item Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
\item Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
\item String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
\item Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
\item Sing (ballad, chant, melody)
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Check:} You can impress audiences with your talent and skill.

10 & Routine performance. Trying to earn money by playing in public is essentially begging. You can earn 1d10 cp/day.\\
15 & Enjoyable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.\\
20 & Great performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.\\
25 & Memorable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.\\
30 & Extraordinary performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant potential patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.\\

A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.

\textbf{Action:} Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's description.

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)

\textbf{Special:} In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with \linkskill{Sleight of Hand}, \linkskill{Tumble}{Tumbling}, \linkskill{Balance}{Tightrope walking}, and spells (especially illusions).
