\skillentry{Profession}{(Wis; Trained Only)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Like \linkskill{Craft} and \linkskill{Perform}, Profession is actually a single skill with several styles. You can have one profession style per rank. If you make a check with respect to a style you have then use your full ranks, otherwise your ranks don't apply to the check (as if you were untrained). While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge.

\textbf{Check:} You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.

\textbf{Action:} Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

\textbf{Untrained:} Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.
