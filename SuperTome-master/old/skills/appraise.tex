%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50\% to 150\% (2d6+3 times 10\%) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.

These bonuses stack.

\textbf{Action:} Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).

\textbf{Try Again:} You can only try another Appraise check with a particular object if you've gained at least 1 rank in Appraise since your last check.

\textbf{Untrained:} For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50\% to 150\% (2d6+3 times 10\%).
