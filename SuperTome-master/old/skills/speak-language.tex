The Speak Language skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work as follows.

\begin{itemize*}
\item You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.
\item You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak.
\item You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or you don't.
\end{itemize*}

A literate character (anyone but a \linkclass{Barbarian} who has not spent skill points to become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.
