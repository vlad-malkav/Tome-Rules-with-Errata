\skillentry{Balance}{(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:

\begin{basictable}{Balance DCs}{l c l c}
\textbf{Narrow Surface} & \textbf{DC\textsuperscript{1}} & \textbf{Difficult Surface} & \textbf{DC}\\
7-12 inches wide & 10 & Uneven Flagstone & 10\textsuperscript{2}\\
2-6 inches wide & 15 & Hewn Stone Floor & 10\textsuperscript{2}\\
Less than 2 inches wide & 20 & Sloped or Angled Floor & 10\textsuperscript{2}\\
\multicolumn{4}{p{13cm}}{\textsuperscript{1} Add modifiers from Narrow Surface Modifiers, below, as appropriate.}\\
\multicolumn{4}{p{13cm}}{\textsuperscript{2} Only if running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means the character can't run or charge, but my otherwise act normally.}\\
\end{basictable}

\begin{basictable}{Narrow Surface Modifiers}{l c}
\textbf{Surface} & \textbf{DC Modifer\textsuperscript{1}}\\
Lightly Obsctructed & +2\\
Severely Obstructed & +5\\
Lightly Slippery & +2\\
Severly Slipper & +5\\
Sloped or Angled & +2\\
\multicolumn{2}{p{7cm}}{\textsuperscript{1} Add the appropriate modifier to the Balance DC of a narrow surface. These modifiers stack.}\\
\end{basictable}

\textit{Being Attacked while Balancing:} You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.

\textit{Accelerated Movement:} You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge.

\textbf{Action:} None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.
