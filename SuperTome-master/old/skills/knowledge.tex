Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.

Below are listed typical fields of study.

\begin{itemize*}
\item Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
\item Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)
\item Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)
\item Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
\item History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
\item Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)
\item Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
\item Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)
\item Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)
\end{itemize*}

The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)

\textbf{Check:} Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.

For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.

\textbf{Action:} Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't take an action -- you simply know the answer or you don't.

\textbf{Try Again:} No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.

\textbf{Untrained:} An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).
