\skillentry{Move Silently}{(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Check:} Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

\begin{basictable}{Move Silently Surface Modifiers}{lc}
\textbf{Surface} & \textbf{Check Modifier}\\
Noisy (scree, shallow or deep bog, undergrowth, dense rubble) & -2 \\
Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow) & -5 \\
\end{basictable}

\textbf{Action:}None. A Move Silently check is included in your movement or other activity, so it is part of another action.
