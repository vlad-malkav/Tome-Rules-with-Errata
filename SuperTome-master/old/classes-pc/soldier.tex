\tagline{"I got so much style, my styles got style."}

The worlds have dozens or even hundreds of sapient races, all of whom have distinctive methods of combat and warfare. And yet, it is demonstrably true that an individual warrior of one species is pretty much interchangeable for one of any other. The true tactical uniqueness comes from the exemplar soldiers of these empires, and those are the dudes who have the actual Soldier class. However, even that only usually applies to low level Soldiers. Those who've fought in many battles get a grasp on the special tactics of the other races and start using them in battle. It is to be noted that some races (such as Osyluth) don't really engage in battle, and instead direct minions to do battle on their behalf. The secrets of battle for these races are then the tricks they drum into soldiers working for them, rather than into their own warriors.

\textbf{Playing A Soldier:} The Soldier has Maneuvers, Stances, and an initiator level and stuff like that. However, while they have these things, they also have a very simple system for using their abilities: they can use any of them they know whenever they want. A Soldier gets a lot of Stances (one per level) and relatively less Maneuvers (one every other level). Deal with it. A Soldier has multiple attribute dependency of Intelligence and Constitution, also they have only a moderate BAB progression. Nonetheless they are serviceable combatants even though Strength and Dexterity are probably like their 3rd or 4th best attributes.

\textbf{Alignment:} Soldiers can and do fight for any cause, sometimes for ideology and other times for pure mercenary interest. A Soldier can be of any alignment, and the class is no marker for level's of fanaticism. The player can choose how strongly they detect their alignment.

\classfeatures

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} A Soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as the racial weapons of any race mentioned in one of their Combat Styles. A Soldier is proficient with Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor in addition to Shields and Great Shields.

\textbf{Soldier Maneuvers (Ex):} As a Soldier gains class levels they learn how to perform amazing maneuvers of daring-do and general badassery which are collectively called "Maneuvers." A Maneuver takes a Standard Action and is an Extraordinary Ability. Many of the Soldier's Stances specifically impact the Soldier's special Soldier Maneuvers, and that refers to these and not just any attack action or full attack they happen to make. A Soldier has an Initiator level equal to their class level. A Soldier learns one maneuver each odd-numbered Soldier level, but they can also abandon any number of maneuvers they already learned whenever they gain a level of any class and learn new maneuvers that they qualify for. Most Soldier Maneuvers allow the character to make a standard attack modified in some fashion. If they are using a double weapon with which they are proficient or two finesseable weapons, they may instead make one standard attack with each weapon (adding only half their Strength bonus to the off-hand weapon), but any special maneuver effects that trigger on damage only trigger once if either or both attacks hit.

\textbf{Secrets of Battle (Ex):} A Soldier adds their Intelligence Modifier (if positive) to their attack rolls, up to a maximum bonus equal to their Soldier Level.

\textbf{Stances (Ex):} While the Soldier is not flatfooted, they may engage a Stance at the cost of one Swift Action per round. Each Stance is usually based on the unique fighting techniques of one of the world's armies that the Soldier has trained in, fought with, or researched. Each Stance is procedurally generated, allowing the character to gain the benefit of their Intelligence bonus to something they don't normally get to do and get a special additional bonus based on the racial combat styles they are emulating. Each Stance also needs a name, which can be generated on the chart at the end of this section.

\textbf{Basic Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to weapon damage.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Armor Class.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Saving Throws.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Strength and Dexterity based Skill Checks.
\item Gain Spell Resistance of 5 + Level + Intelligence Modifier.
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Basic Race List:}
\begin{description*}
\item[Aasimar:] The Soldier ignores Concealment (but not Full Concealment) unless that Concealment comes from poor lighting. Full Concealment is treated as regular Concealment unless it comes from total darkness.
\item[Drow:] If the Soldier inflicts damage on a target, they may convert all the damage to Subdual and cause 2 points of Strength Damage.
\item[Dwarf:] The Soldier resists things with great facility. If presented with a Fortitude or Willpower save for Partial, the character receives the Partial effect on a failed save and no effect at all on a successful save.
\item[Elf:] The Soldier can take their Standard Action in the middle of their Move Action, continuing their movement after the Standard Action is resolved.
\item[Gnome:] When the Soldier inflicts damage onto a creature, that creature cannot see the Soldier until the beginning of the Soldier's next turn. It's like they were invisible, or crawling around underneath them or something.
\item[Goblin:] The Soldier can redirect any attacks against their mount to themselves, and may choose to have their mount discounted from an area of effect if they are are still within it.
\item[Halfling:] The Soldier can throw any weapon they are proficient with to full effect as if they had made a melee attack with it -- even for Manuvers that require a melee attack to function. A light weapon has a range increment of 30', a one-handed weapon has a range of 20', and a two handed weapon has a range increment of 10' (multiplied by the creature's base reach). A weapon thrown in this way gains a +2 to-hit for the what-the-crap factor.
\item[Hobgoblin:] The Soldier does not generate the -10 penalty to Move Silently for moving quickly, nor do they suffer the -20 penalty to Move Silently for engaging in combat.
\item[Human:] The Soldier can use any weapon or armor no matter how obscure without problem. The character is considered proficient with any weapons or armors even if exotic or improvised. The character also ignores armor check penalties and armor stealth penalties.
\item[Kobold:] When the soldier inflicts damage on a target they may as a free action place something that they have as a stored item in the target's square. Common choices include smoke sticks, thunderstones, caltrops, and feather tokens.
\item[Orc:] The character is considered to be one size category larger for purposes where that would be good such as carrying capacity, using weapons one handed, and tripping.
\item[Tiefling:] The Soldier has Full Concealment if poor lighting would give them Concealment.
\end{description*}


\textbf{Hardened Survivor (Ex):} A 2nd level Soldier has resigned themselves to living in crappy conditions on both sides of a siege, and resigned themselves to eating things that a less martially oriented person would refuse out of hand. They may add their Constitution modifier to their Survival checks instead of their Wisdom Modifier. They also increase their Death Margin by their ranks in Survival.

\textbf{Wearing Shoes (Ex):} A 3rd level Soldier really understands how Charlie thinks. Also how K'zrtlk thinks. And they can totally emulate those dudes. The Soldier gains a bonus to Disguise equal to their ranks in Disguise, and suffers no penalty for disguising themselves as a different race.

\textbf{Lucky (Ex):} It's amazing how a lucky veteran keeps coming back from amazingly dangerous situations. A 3rd level Soldier gains a Luck bonus to their Saving Throws equal to their Constitution Modifier, to a maximum of their Class Level. They also never have to make saves against massive damage.

\textbf{Mighty Stances:} From 4th level on, a Soldier can select their racial bonuses for their stances from the Mighty Races list.

\textbf{Mighty Races:}
\begin{description*}
\item[Bugbear:] If the Soldier hits a target with a Maneuver and that opponent is denied their Dexterity bonus to AC or flanked, the Soldier inflicts an extra d6 of sneak attack damage per 2 class levels.
\item[Dark Creeper:] The Soldier sees in any darkness, even magical darkness, like a frickin Devil.
\item[Deep One:] Whenever the Soldier is attacked in melee with a weapon, they may make a free melee attack roll. If they score higher on their roll than the attacker did, the attacker drops their weapon. The original attack still hits or misses normally.
\item[Gnoll:] Enemies who are flanked by the Soldier are considered to be in difficult terrain and cannot take a 5' step.
\item[Lizardfolk:] When attacking from Concealment or Cover, the target is denied their Dexterity bonus as if the Soldier was attacking from Full Concealment.
\item[Mushroomfolk:] If the Soldier inflicts damage on a target, they may convert all the damage to Subdual and force the target to make a Will Save (DC 10 + half Level + Int Modifier) or be confused for 1 round / level.
\item[Sahuagin:] The Soldier can breathe water or air as whichever one would be preferable, and has a Land and Swim Speed equal to their highest of either.
\item[Skulk:] The Soldier has Concealment, and people have to deal with a 20\% miss chance. This provides a +4 bonus to Hide checks.
\item[Thri-Kreen:] The Soldier can leap for stupidly ridiculous distances. Each round, the Soldier can make an additional jump with a bonus equal to their level as a free action. This jump is not limited by height and any movement is completed that round, does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and does not count against the character's normal movement.
\item[Troglodyte:] Opponents who are nauseated in your threatened range do not get a Move Action and all attacks against them receive a +2 bonus to-hit and damage.
\end{description*}

\textbf{Veteran's Experience (Ex):} A 5th level Soldier has seen crazy crap and come out craftier for it. They gain an Enhancement bonus to their Intelligence equal to one third of their character level (round up).

\textbf{Leader of Men:} At 6th level, a Soldier gains Command as a bonus feat. If they already have Command, they can take another [Leadership] Feat that they qualify for instead.

\textbf{Boots Keep Walking (Ex):} At level 7 and again at levels 9, 11, and 13 a Soldier's experience fighting on the battlefields of the Heavy Metalish terrain that dots the landscape grants them special abilities related to that terrain experience. Every time the Soldier gains one of these Terrain-based abilities they also gain a cumulative +2 bonus to all Survival tests as they are able to generalize their specific experiences into relevancies in other circumstances.

\textbf{Terrain Powers}
\begin{description*}
\item[Cave Crawler:] The Soldier suffers no penalty for squeezing. The Soldier's movement speed is not reduced during poor visibility.
\item[Cliff Jumper:] The Soldier gains a Climb Speed equal to half their land speed. The Soldier ignores difficult terrain caused by uneven stone.
\item[Ice Skater:] The Soldier gains Energy Resistance to Cold equal to their Character Level. They ignore the effects of any decreased temperatures.
\item[Inferno Commando:] The Soldier gains Energy Resistance to Fire equal to their Character Level. They ignore the effects of any increased temperatures.
\item[Jungle Fighter:] The Soldier can move through difficult terrain caused by vegetation as if it wasn't there, counts cover from vegetation as if it was one stage better in both directions (so 50\% cover would provide them a +6 AC bonus but only a +2 AC bonus to enemies), and does not take damage or get entangled from enchanted vegetation such as entangle or briar web.
\item[Planar Champion:] The Soldier ignores Planar Traits that would suck for them such as "Lawfully Aligned" or "Prison Plane" - not the Gravity or Time traits.
\item[Swamp Beast:] The Soldier is able to ignore difficult terrain that is caused by an area being water logged. Also they are immune to the nauseated condition.
\item[Waste Warrior:] The Soldier takes twice as long to dehydrate and takes half damage from dessication effects. Also they take no damage from and their visibility is not impaired by dust storms, smoke clouds, ash rains, and any similar stuff.

Also the character can change shape into the target as per whatever version of alter self you're using.
\item[Kyton:] The Soldier's threatened area extends for an extra 20' in all directions.
\item[Nerra:] Any time the Soldier successfully negates a spell, or supernatural or spell-like ability targeted against them with a successful Saving Throw or Spell Resistance, the spell is reflected against the caster of the spell as per spell turning.
\item[Ogre:] If the Soldier inflicts damage with an attack of opportunity, the action that provoked the attack of opportunity is not completed.

\item[Starfolk:] If any creature uses a [Teleport] or plane shift effect within the Soldier's line of sight, they may elect to immediately teleport to a point that is adjacent to the creature's new location. Creatures cannot use Psionic abilities defensively within the Soldier's threatened area.

\item[Fire Giant:] The Soldier can cause a burst of fire damage every time they inflict damage with a Maneuver. This is a 15' burst that inflicts half as much damage as the attack inflicted and is centered on the target. It s all fire damage, and a Reflex Save halves that damage.

\textbf{Logistics Master (Ex):} A 14th level Soldier is a master of War and can manage supply lines intuitively. The Soldier can use their Survival skill to manage Logistics on any scale from the personal to the Imperial.

\textbf{Going Places (Sp):} A 15th level Soldier can follow anything to anywhere. By touching something from another plane, they may \linkspell{Planeshift} to the plane of the creature or object's origin. Since it is easy to touch yourself, a Soldier can always return to their own plane of origin. This can also be used to banish things to their home plane of existence, if they fail a willpower save.

\item[Ethergaunt:] Any time the Soldier strikes a target with a Maneuver, they may create an antimagic field that fills the 5' square they struck for one round.

\item[Rakshasa:] The Soldier is unaffected by spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities of 6th level or less, as if they were carrying a greater orb of invulnerability around.
\item[Storm Giant:] The Soldier is unaffected by Weather effects. Also, whenever the Soldier inflicts damage with a Maneuver, they may strike any other targets (of their choice) within 60' with a lightning bolt that does half that much damage (Reflex Save for Half again).
\end{description*}

\textbf{Mass Desertion (Ex):} An 18th level Soldier is a dreaded thing. When he takes to the field, enemies know their cause is hopeless.

\textbf{World Conquest (Ex):} At 20th level, the Soldier wins the game.

\subsubsection{Naming Your Stances}
%%%

When you name your styles, be sure to have the representative species name in there somewhere, and also generate an adjective and a noun to name the stance. The racial word can go in the first, second, or third position depending on what sounds better. So when making a Drow style, you could have the "Underhanded Grandeur of the Drow" or the "Drow Invincible Method" or the "Informal Drow Approach".
