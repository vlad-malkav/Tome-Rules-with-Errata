You can totally flip out and kill someone with your gymnastic prowess. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Tumble.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to Tumble checks.

\textbf{4:} When using the Combat Expertise option, your dodge bonus to AC increases by +1. This further increases by +1 for every ten ranks of Tumble you have (+2 at 14, +3 at 24, and so on).

\textbf{9:} If an opponent attempts to bull-rush, overrun, or trample you, if you succeed on Tumble check of DC 25 + their base attack bonus, their movement continues in a straight line to the maximum allowed by their speed, you remain where you were, and you don't suffer from the effects of their bull-rush, overrun, or trample. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from that enemy.

\textbf{14:} If you succeed on a DC 40 Tumble check, you can move 10 feet when taking a 5-foot step.

\textbf{19:} If you succeed on a Tumble check against a DC of 30 + an opponent's base attack bonus, an action that would normally provoke an attack of opportunity doesn't.

You can't use this ability again until any animals you've summoned with it have unsummoned or you've dismissed them.

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain +3 to your Heal checks.

\textbf{4:} You can make first aid, treat poison, and treat wound checks as move actions.

\textbf{9:} For every 5 points your Heal check exceeds the DC for long term care, your patients recover another +100\% faster. For instance, if your Heal check result is 23, your patients would heal at thrice the normal rate.

\textbf{14:} If you operate on a patient for a minute, they regain hit points equal to your Heal check result. You also may, with a DC 30 check, instead of healing hit point damage, cure any condition that \linkspell{Heal} could, reattach severed limbs, or repair ruined organs. Patients under your long-term care heal permanent ability drain as if it was ability damage.

\textbf{19:} With one hour of work, 50,000 gp worth of materials (which are consumed in the process), and a DC 40 Heal check, you can restore a creature that died within the last twenty-four hours to life. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return for the effect to work.

Your patient comes back from the dead with full hit points and all conditions cured, with no loss of prepared spells or spell slots. You must have a reasonably intact body to work with, though you can reattach missing parts, if you have them, and repair organs.

You can restore life to a creature killed by a death effect. You cannot affect constructs, elementals, outsiders (except native outsiders), and undead creatures, nor creatures that have died of old age.

\textbf{4:} Magic effects that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth must succeed on a caster level check with DC equal to 10 plus your bonus on Diplomacy checks or fail.

\textbf{9:} Divination magic used on you detects a false alignment of your choice. You can present false surface thoughts to detect thoughts and similar effects, changing your apparent Intelligence score (and thus your apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in your "surface thoughts" to be read by such spells or effects.

\textbf{14:} If you beat someone's Sense Motive check by 25, you can instill a suggestion in them, as the spell. This suggestion lasts for one hour for each of your character levels.

\textbf{14:} When you cast a spell from a scroll, the spell's save DC is equal to 10 + the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier + any other applicable bonuses, and its caster level is equal to your character level, plus other applicable bonuses.

\textbf{19:} Reading text using Decipher Script is a free action for you. You may disable written magical traps as a swift action, and you can cast 5th-level or lower spells from scrolls as a swift action.

Your amazing manual dexterity is the talk of princes and princesses. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Sleight of Hand.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus on your Sleight of Hand checks.

\textbf{4:} If you draw a hidden weapon and attack with it in the same round, your opponent loses their Dexterity bonus to AC against your first attack with that weapon that round.

\textbf{9:} You can make an adjacent creature or object your size or smaller 'disappear' with your legerdemain. If you succeed on a DC 30 Sleight of Hand check as a standard action, your target can make a Hide check, or you can make the Hide check for them or it. As usual, you can hide larger creatures or objects by taking a -20 cumulative penalty for each size category larger they are than you.

\textbf{9:} With 2d6 hours of research, you can study a specific topic, such as a particular location or a well-known local monster, and substitute a Gather Information check for any Knowledge checks pertaining to the topic. You need access to local informants, a library, scholars, or other appropriate sources to use this ability.

\textbf{14:} You can gain the benefits of legend lore with a DC 30 Gather Information check. If you have the person or thing at hand, or are in the place, this takes a day; otherwise, it consumes the time as normal for legend lore. You need access to individuals or resources with relevant knowledge to use this ability.

\textbf{19:} With a DC 40 Gather Information check and 1d4+1 days of talking to people, you can either find an answer to any question you can pose in ten words or less, or find out where you need to go to get the answer. You need access to individuals or resources with relevant knowledge to use this ability.

\textbf{9:} In situations where you can present a legal document of some sort, you can substitute a Forgery check for a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check.

\textbf{14:} You can purchase items with counterfeit bills of exchange, falsified credit vouchers, and the like. You can acquire any item available through the gold economy in this method. Normally, your counterfeits are so good they don't provoke suspicion, but if someone examines them, they must still beat you in an opposed Forgery check to recognize they're not the real thing.

\textbf{19:} You can duplicate a scroll with eight hours of work and a Forgery check against DC 35 + the spell's level. The duplicate functions in all manners like the original scroll. You must have appropriate materials on hand for scribing the scroll, and if the spell requires XP or expensive material components, you must provide the requisite components or make up the XP cost in materials.

%%%
\featentry{Ghost Step}{[Skill]}
%%%

You might as well be incorporeal for all the noise you make. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Move Silently.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain +3 to your Move Silently checks.

\textbf{4:} Anyone attempting to use Survival to track you must beat you in an opposed check against Move Silently.

\textbf{9:} Creatures with blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or similar abilities do not automatically detect your presence, but must succeed on a Listen check, opposed by your Move Silently check, to notice you.

\textbf{14:} With success on a DC 30 Move Silently check as a standard action, you can control ambient sounds within 30 feet of yourself for a round. You can specifically duplicate any effect from control sound (XPH), silence, or ventriloquism, and in general can make sound you've heard come from any part of the area, displace sounds in the area, or suppress any sounds or sounds. Also, if you take a -10 DC penalty on your Move Silently check, anyone within 30 feet of you can substitute your check result for their own.

\textbf{19:} You're so quiet that people don't even remember you when you're standing right next to them. Your opponents count as flat-footed whenever you attack them.

%%%
\featentry{Investigator}{[Skill]}
%%%

You have an eye for detail and so much patience that going through a 100' by 100' room inch-by-inch doesn't even try it. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Search.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You can use Search to find traps like a character with trapfinding. If you already have that ability, you gain +3 to your Search checks. Search is always a class skill for you.

\textbf{4:} You can Search a 10' by 10' area with a full-round action.

\textbf{9:} You automatically sense any active magic effects in an area you search. If you succeed on a DC 20 Search check, you can determine their number, strength, and school, as if using detect magic.

\textbf{14:} You can Search objects or areas within 30 feet of yourself. You can make a Search check as a swift action.

\textbf{19:} You have an intuitive sense for hidden things. Anytime something that someone has hidden is within 60 feet of you, you know it; if there are multiple things, you know how many. However, you must still make Search checks as normal to locate them.

\textbf{19:} When you activate a wand or staff, you can substitute a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one you have not used for the day, though you may lose a prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (you may not lose prepared spells from your school of specialty, if any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the spell stored in the wand, including any level-increasing metamagic enhancements. When using spell trigger, spell completion, or other consumable magic items, if you succeed on a Use Magic Device check of 40 + the caster level of the item as a swift action, the item or charges thereof are not consumed.

\featentry{Leap of the Heavens}{[Skill]}
%%%

You jump good. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Jump.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to Use Rope checks and proficiency with the bolas, net, and whip.

\textbf{4:} You can use a rope as if it was a bolas or whip, and you can substitute your ranks in Use Rope for your Base Attack Bonus for combat maneuvers made with it. You can also use it as a net, replacing the normal DC 20 Escape Artist check for someone entangled with it with your Use Rope check. You can throw a grappling hook, tie a knot, tie a special knot, or tie a rope around yourself one-handed as a move action. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for using Use Rope.

\textbf{9:} You can use a rope, whip, grappling hook, or similar item to manipulate any item within 30 feet of yourself as easily as if it was in your hands; you can also make disarm, entangling (as if with a net), and trip attempts with it. You can move around on ropes and similar structures, like webs, as easily as you can on the ground.

\textbf{14:} With a DC 30 Use Rope check, you can use animate rope as a spell-like ability; you can use any ability you can with an ordinary rope with an animated rope.

\textbf{14:} You can create a disguise as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty to your Disguise check. You can't be under direct observation while doing this, but you can use Bluff to create a diversion to allow you to change guises, as for the Hide skill.

\textbf{19:} You can choose an appearance that anyone viewing you with scrying or other divination magic sees instead of your "real" appearance. Even someone who benefits from true seeing must succeed on a caster level check (DC 11 + your ranks in Disguise) to penetrate the illusion.


%%%
\featentry{Mounted Combat}{[Skill]}
%%%

You are at your best when fighting with an ally that you are sitting on. This is a Skill Feat that scales with your ranks in Ride.

\textbf{Benefits:} Once per turn, you may attempt to negate an attack that hits your mount by making a Ride skill check with a DC equal to the AC that the attack hit. Attacks that do not require an attack roll cannot be negated in this way.

\textbf{4:} While Mounted, you may take a charge attack at any point along your mount's movement, so long as your mount is moving in a straight line up to the point of your attack.

\textbf{9:} You suffer no penalty to your ride or handle animal skill checks when training or riding unusual mounts such as magical beasts or dragons.

\textbf{14:} You may use your Ride Check in place of your mount's Balance, Jump, Climb, or Reflex Saving Throws.

\textbf{19:} Any time a spell effect would target your mount, you may elect to have it target you instead. Any time a spell effect would target you, you may elect to have it affect your Mount instead.

%%%
\featentry{Natural Empath}{[Skill]}
%%%

You read people like books. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Sense Motive.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to Sense Motive checks.

\textbf{4:} You can quickly size up potential opponents. If you succeed on a Sense Motive check as a free action, opposed by their Bluff, you can tell if they're an even match (their CR equals your character level), an easy challenge (their CR is 1-3 less than your level), irrelevant (their CR is 4 or more less than your level), stronger (their CR is 1-3 higher than your level), or overwhelmingly powerful (their CR is 4 or more higher than your level). You can use this ability once on a particular creature every 24 hours.

\textbf{9:} If you succeed on a Sense Motive check, opposed by Bluff, you know your opponent's alignment. If you beat their Bluff by 20 or more, you can read their surface thoughts, as if during the third round of detect thoughts.

\textbf{14:} You have an uncanny intuition for when people are interested in you. Any time someone uses a remote spell or effect, like scrying, to examine you, you know you're under observation and if you make a Sense Motive check that beats their Bluff check, you know some details about them: if you've met them before, you recognize them, but if not, you get a basic idea of their reasons for their interest in you. Similarly, if you use Sense Motive on someone influenced by an enchantment effect, you can find out who created the effect with a Sense Motive check opposed by the controller's Bluff, getting the same information.

\textbf{19:} You know what people are going to do before they do. Any time someone you're aware of attacks you, make a Sense Motive check opposed by their Bluff: if you succeed, you get a free surprise round.

%%%
\featentry{Persuasive}{[Skill]}
%%%

When you tell you people something that contradicts the evidence of their own eyes, they believe you. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Diplomacy.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to Diplomacy checks.

\textbf{4:} Your words can stop fights before they start. Any creature that can hear you speak must make a Will save (DC 10 + half your character level + your Cha modifier) or it can't attack you directly; however, you aren't protected from its area or effect spells, or similar abilities. Any creature that succeeds on its save is immune to this ability for 24 hours. You may use nonattack spells or otherwise act, but if you attack the creature or its allies, it may attack you. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent charm effect.

\textbf{9:} You can fascinate creatures with your silver tongue. You can affect as many HD of creatures as your bonus on Diplomacy checks; any creature that fails a Will save (DC 10 + half your character level + your Cha modifier) becomes fascinated. If you use this ability in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2. While a subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude, allowing you to make a single request of an affected creature. The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it. 

\textbf{14:} You can influence even hostile creatures into talking things over with you. With a DC 30 Diplomacy check, you can use a language-dependent version of charm monster as a spell-like ability, with save DC equal to 10 + half your character level + your Cha modifier; this is a mind-affecting charm effect.

\textbf{19:} You can convince an entire group of enemies to listen to you. If you succeed on a DC 40 Diplomacy check, your charm monster ability improves to mass charm monster, with a caster level equal to your bonus on Diplomacy checks.

\featentry{Professional Luddite}{[Skill]}
%%%
You've learned to break machines because you're an antitechnology fanaticâ€”or maybe you just work for the local protection racket. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Disable Device.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You can use Disable Device on magic traps like a character with trapfinding. If you already have that ability, you gain +3 to your Disable Device checks. Disable Device is always a class skill for you.

\textbf{4:} You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for Disable Device checks. Darkness and blindness do not hinder your ability to disable devices.

\textbf{9:} You can reduce the amount of time required to disable a device. For each multiple of 10 you beat the required DC, you can decrease the time required from 2d4 rounds to 1d4 rounds to 1 round to a standard action to a move-equivalent action to a free action.

\textbf{14:} You can use Disable Device to end any persistent effect or area spell effect as if it was a magic trap, but the DC is 25 + twice the spell's level.

\textbf{19:} As an attack action, you can disable magic items. You must succeed on a melee touch attack roll for attended objects. Make a Disable Device check against a DC of 15 + the item's caster level: if your check succeeds, the item must make a Will save against a DC of 10 + half your caster level or be turned into a normal item, and even if it saves, its magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.

Nothing escapes you. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Spot.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to Spot checks.

\textbf{4:} You can make a Spot check once a round as a free action. You don't take penalties for distractions on your Spot checks.

\textbf{9:} As a move action, you can make a Spot check against a DC of an opponent's Armor Class: if you succeed, you can ignore their Armor and Natural Armor bonus to AC for the next attack you make against them. If you accept a -20 penalty to your check, you can attempt this check as a swift action. Divide any distance penalties you take on Spot checks by two.

\textbf{14:} If you beat an opponent's Hide check with a Spot check at a -10 penalty, you can ignore concealment. If you beat their Hide check at a -30 penalty, you can ignore total concealment.

\textbf{19:} You can see through solid objects, but you take a -20 penalty on your Spot check for each 5'. Divide any distance penalties you take on Spot checks by five.

Your childhood nickname was "Greasy the Pig", but now people call you "The Great Hamster". (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Escape Artist.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain +3 to your Escape Artist checks.

\textbf{4:} While squeezing into a space at least half as wide as your normal space, you may move your normal speed and you take no penalty to your attack rolls or AC for squeezing.

\textbf{9:} You can squeeze through a tight space or an extremely tight space as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty to your Escape Artist check. Opponents grappling you don't get positive size modifiers added to their grapple bonus when you use Escape Artist to try to break their hold.

\textbf{14:} If you succeed on a DC 30 Escape Artist check, you can ignore magical effects that impede movement as if you were under the effects of freedom of movement for one round; this is not an action. You can also slip through a wall of force or similar barrier with a DC 40 check.

\textbf{19:} You can make an Escape Artist check instead of a saving throw for any effect that would keep you from taking actions. (This does not help against effects that don't allow a saving throw.)

You can fight just about anywhere. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Balance.)

\textbf{4:} If an effect would knock you prone, if you succeed on a DC 20 Balance check, you remain standing.

\textbf{9:} If your opponent is balancing, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks unless they succeed at beating you in an opposed Balance check.

\textbf{14:} All Balance DCs are halved for you.

\textbf{19:} You never suffer any impairment or damage from anything you're standing on, whether it's molten lava, a cloud, or even another creature. Ambient conditions, such as lighting or weather, can still impair you.

If someone sees you, you have to kill them. (This is a Skill feat that scales with your ranks in Hide.)

\textbf{Benefits:} You gain a +3 bonus to your Hide checks.

\textbf{4:} You can Hide as a free action after attacking, and snipe with melee attacks (or ranged attacks from closer than 10').

\textbf{9:} A constant nondetection effect protects you and your equipment, with an effective caster level equal to your ranks in Hide.

\textbf{14:} You can attempt to Hide even when under direct observation, but you take the usual -20 penalty to your check.

\textbf{19:} Even opponents who can see you have trouble locating you. If they succeed at beating your Hide check with Spot (and thus can see you), they have a 50\% concealment miss chance when attacking you, which decreases by 5\% for each point they beat your Hide DC.

\textbf{14:} You can track through the Astral Plane with a DC 35 Survival check. You can determine the destination of a teleport spell when standing at the point of departure with a DC 40 Survival check; if you have teleport or a similar spell, you can follow as if you had seen the destination once.

\textbf{19:} You're immune to natural planar effects as if you had planar tolerance always active.
