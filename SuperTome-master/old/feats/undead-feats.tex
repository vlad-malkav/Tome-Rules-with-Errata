The powers of the undead are legendary, in part because they are so varied. A feat with the [Undead] tag can only be selected or used by a character who is Undead.

\featentry{Enervating Touch}{[Undead]}
%%%

Your undead nature allows you to drain the life out of living victims.

\textbf{Benefit:} Your unarmed attacks and natural weapons inflict one negative level. The DC to remove that negative level is Charisma based. You gain 5 temporary hit points every time you inflict a negative level on an intelligent creature in this way.

\featentry{Control Spawn}{[Undead]}
%%%

Your victims serve you eternally in death.

\textbf{Prerequisite:} \linkfeat{Enervating Touch}

\textbf{Benefit:} when a creature dies from the negative levels you inflict and rises as a Wight, it comes under your control. At any one time, you may control a number of Wights in this manner equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). If you create additional Wights, you choose which spawn you lose control over.

%%%
\featentry{Paralyzing Touch}{[Undead]}
%%%

The touch of your clawed hand freezes the lifeblood of the hardiest of mortals.

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Ghoul

\textbf{Benefit:} Your unarmed strikes and natural attacks cause \linkcondition{Paralysis} for one minute unless your victim makes a Fortitude save. This save is Charisma based.
