SuperTome
=========

SuperTome is a Tome compilation PDF. The intent is that it be a complete
resource for playing Tome games. Naturally you still might care to use other
sources in your game as well, but the idea is that you shouldn't need to.

Tome itself, for those that don't know, is an outgrowth of the Third Edition
game, as described in the SRD. Originally, the Tomes were written to be as
backwards compatible as possible. Only adding classes, feats, and so on
without actually taking anything away. However, as with all such projects,
over time it became clear that there's only so much you can do without making
any breaking changes to the system. So, some changes that do break backwards
compatibility were introduced. New entries for some skills, changes to how
magic items work, and so on.
