Characters get 1 feat at 1st level, and one additional feat at every level divisible by three. They can also get extra feats from different effects.

Some feats have prerequisites that you must meet before you can select and use them, though most do not. If you have a feat that you lost the prerequisites for somehow, you can't use that feat while you lack the prerequisites. Some effects grant bonus feats. If an effect grants a specific bonus feat that has prerequisites, that effect counts as satisfying the prerequisites even if you would not normally meet them. If an effect lets you pick a bonus feat (including off a list, or a category such as "any [Combat] feat", etc.), then you must pick a bonus feat that you meet the prerequisites for normally, just as though it were any other feat selection.
