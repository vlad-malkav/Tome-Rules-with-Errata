\item \racesize{Medium}
\item \racetype{Fey}
\item \racemovement{30ft}
\item \racevision{Low-light vision}
\item +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution. Feytouched are graceful and those which are not beautiful are terrifying, but they are fragile like flowers.
\item Immunity to [Compulsion] Effects.
\item \textbf{Magic Affinity (Sp):} Every Feytouched is different, and marked by the signature magics of the fey in a different manner. Every Feytouched has one spell that can be used once per day as a spell-like ability. This spell is chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed. Any 1st level Illusion or Enchantment spell from the Sorcerer/Wizard list is fair game, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

\item \racelang{Common and Sylvan}
\item \raceextralang{Aquan, Auran, Elvish, Draconic, Dwarvish, Druidic, Goblin, Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling}
